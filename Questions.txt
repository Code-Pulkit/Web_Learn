    DRF - Django Rest Framework 
    Django - INSTALLED APPS - Monolithic
    Django Used in InstaGram , Mozilla FireFox
    
    Django follows Model-View Template (MVT) architectural pattern.
    
    Advantages of Django - 
      1. Comes with Build authentication, content administration
      2. CSRF - Cross Site Request Forgery  { % csrf_token % } 
      
    Views in Django --> Basically CallBack Functions for specific URL 
    --> Model and Template 
    
    django-admin createsuperuser / 
    python manage.py runserver / makemigrations / migrate 
   
    Django Comes with a basic SQLite Server.
    
    __init__.py ==> An empty file that tells Python that the current directory should be considered as a Python package
    
    Models --> Can be defined and would map to single specific database
   
    Views --> They encapsulate the logic liable for processing a userâ€™s request and for returning the response back to the user.
              Can return HttpResponse or raise an exception such as Http404
    
    Template --> Return the HTML dynamically 
    Django Static FIle 
    
    Middleware is a framework that is light and low-level plugin system for altering Djangoâ€™s input and output globally. 
    It is basically a framework of hooks into the request/ response processing of Django.

    is_active and is_staff is True 
    
    Use of MiddleWare - 
    1. CSRF 
    2. Session Management
    3. User Authentication

     Settings.py holds the configuration of the project like your database connection, apps configuration, absolute path values, 
     static files configuration, and the overall command center to the project. 
     
     To change the Database --> Main App / Settings.py 
        add a 'new' database
        with Engine --> Database 
        Name , User , Password , Host , Port
    
    Makemigrations - Scan the Model and command generates SQL commands for changing in the DataBase
    Migrate - Finally make the changes 
    
    {{}} --> Just PlaceHolders for Variables 
    {%%} --> Logic (Loop)
    
    MEDIA_ROOT --> User Generated Content
