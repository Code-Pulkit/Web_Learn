Hoisting - All variables and functions are moved to top.
           "use strict" - to avoid hoisting 

 == is used to compare the values whereas === is used to compate value as well as type.
Variables have no type in JS (Dynamic Typing).
Assign Operater directly pass by address.
--> (function (){}) is defined in such a way.
