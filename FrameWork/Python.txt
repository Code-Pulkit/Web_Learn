List are mutable and slower. []
Tuples are immutable and faster. ()
Sets are unique. {}
A dictionary stores values in key and value pairs where each value can be accessed through its key. {key : value}

Python is an interpreted Language - No need to compile before Running.
Writing Python code is quick but running it is often slower than compiled languages.
Python is well suited to object orientated programming in that it allows the definition of classes along with composition and inheritance.
Dynamically Typed - 

Decorators are used to add some design patterns to a function without changing its structure.

Slicing in Python - (In List , Tuples and Strings )
  1. [start:end:step] ==> 
    If the start or end element is negative i, it means the ith element from the end.
    
    Indentation is necessary for Python.
    It specifies a block of code. All code within loops, classes, functions, etc is specified within an indented block.
   
   Arrays and lists, in Python, have the same way of storing data. 
   But, arrays can hold only a single data type elements whereas lists can hold any data type elements.

An anonymous function is known as a lambda function. This function can have any number of parameters but, can have just one statement.

 The only difference is that range returns a Python list object and x range returns an xrange object.
    This means that xrange doesnâ€™t actually generate a static list at run-time like range does. 
    It creates the values as you need them with a special technique called yielding.
